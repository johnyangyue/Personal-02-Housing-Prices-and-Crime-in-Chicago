# Housing Prices and Crime in Chicago

## Introduction
The project explores the Chicago crime data and its relationship with community area level housing prices. The goal is to obtain insights on how the housing market in each community area reacts to changes in criminal activities. The result shows that the correlations between housing prices and crime vary by community area. Moreover, the correlation becomes more negative as the median housing price increases. One possible hypothesis is that local economic conditions such as infrastructures and amenities may play a role in determining the elasticity of the housing price to crime.

## Data Source
The Chicago crime data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. It is available for public query via Kaggle/Google Cloud.

The community area level housing price data is obtained from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). The dataset represents a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of typical home value across region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range.

The population data used to calculate crime rate for each community area is from the U.S. 2010 Census. It can be accessed via [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning](https://datahub.cmap.illinois.gov/dataset/2010-census-data-summarized-to-chicago-community-areas).
